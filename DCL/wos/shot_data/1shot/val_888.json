{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? the endocannabinoid (ecb) system has attracted attention for its role in various behavioral and brain functions, and as a therapeutic target in neuropsychiatric disease states, including anxiety disorders and other conditions resulting from dysfunctional responses to stress. in this mini-review, we highlight components of the ecb system that offer potential 'druggable' targets for new anxiolytic medications, emphasizing some of the less well-discussed options. we discuss how selectively amplifying ecbs recruitment by interfering with ecb-degradation, via fatty acid amide hydrolase (faah) and monoacylglycerol lipase (magl), has been linked to reductions in anxiety-like behaviors in rodents and variation in human anxiety symptoms. we also discuss a non-canonical route to regulate ecb degradation that involves interfering with cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2). next, we discuss approaches to targeting ecb receptor-signaling in ways that do not involve the cannabinoid receptor subtype 1 (cb1r); by targeting the cb2r subtype and the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (trpv1). finally, we review evidence that cannabidiol (cbd), while representing a less specific pharmacological approach, may be another way to modulate ecbs and interacting neurotransmitter systems to alleviate anxiety. taken together, these various approaches provide a range of plausible paths to developing novel compounds that could prove useful for treating trauma-related and anxiety disorders. published by elsevier ltd. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Medical, label2:Anxiety"}
{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? background: telomeres are repeated sequences (the hexanucleotide ttaggg in vertebrates) located at chromosome ends of eukaryotes, protecting dna from end joining or degradation. telomeres become shorter with each cell cycle, but telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex, alleviates this attrition. the telomerase rna component (terc) is an essential element of telomerase, serving as a template for telomere elongation. the h/aca domain of terc is indispensable for telomere biogenesis. mutations in the telomerase components allow accelerated telomere loss, resulting in various disease manifestations, including bone marrow failure. to date, this is the first detailed report of an h-box mutation in terc that is related to human disease. case presentation: a 26-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) had very short telomeres. sequencing identified a single heterozygous mutation in the h box of the patient 's terc gene. the same mutation was also present in his father and his son, demonstrating that it was germline in origin. the telomere length in the father 's blood was shorter compared to age-matched healthy controls, while it was normal in the son and also in the sperm cells of the patient. in vitro experiments suggested that the mutation was responsible for the telomere shortening in the patient 's leukocytes and contributed to the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure in our patient. conclusion: we analyzed a mutation (a377g) in the h box of terc in a young mds patient who had significantly short-for-age telomeres. as telomeres protect chromosomes from instability, it is highly plausible that this genetic lesion was responsible for the patient 's hematological manifestations, including marrow failure and aneuploidy in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:biochemistry, label2:Southern blotting"}

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? the immune system plays a crucial role in the progression of alzheimer 's disease (ad). recently, immune-dependent cascade induced by systemic immune activation has been verified to play a beneficial role in ad mouse models. here, we tested whether bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) immunization alters ad pathology and cognitive dysfunction in app/ps1 ad mouse model, and with 4a beta 1-15 vaccination as positive control. it was found that bcg treatment reversed the cognitive decline to the extent observed in 4a beta 1-15group, but did not reduce the pamyloid (a beta) burden in the brain. then, we demonstrated the enhanced recruitment of inflammation-resolving monocytes across the choroid plexus and perivascular spaces to cerebral sites of plaque pathology in app/ps1 mice immunized with bcg. furthermore, elevated splenocyte foxp3+ regulatory t cell levels in the control app/ps1 mice were down-regulated back to the wild-type (wt) levels by bcg treatment but not 4a beta 1-15 vaccination. in addition, bcg treatment induced the production of more circulating interferon (ifn)-gamma than the controls and 4a beta 1-15 vaccination. though the similar reductions in brain levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in the bcg and 4a beta 1-15groups compared to the controls, only bcg had the great effect in upregulating cerebral anti-inflammatory cytokine levels as well as elevating the expression of neurotrophic factors in the brain of app/psi mice. thus, it is suggested that bcg exerts a beneficial immunomodulatory effect in app/ps1 mice through mitigation of systemic immune suppression, induction of ifn-'y response and alleviation of the neuroinflammatory response.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (ofdm) is a popular transmission format for emerging wireless communication systems, including satellite radio, various wireless local area network (lan) standards, and digital broadcast television. single-carrier cyclic-prefixed (sccp) modulation is similar to ofdm, but with all frequency-domain operations performed at the receiver. systems employing ofdm and sccp perform well in the presence of multipath provided that the channel delay spread is shorter than the guard interval between transmitted blocks. if this condition is not met, a channel-shortening equalizer can be used to shorten the channel to the desired length. in modestly time-varying environments, an adaptive channel shortener is of interest. all existing adaptive channel shorteners require renormalization to restrain the channel shortener away from zero. in this paper, we study the use of a unit-tap constraint rather than a unit-norm constraint on the adaptive channel shortener. we use this constraint to manipulate existing algorithms into a framework analogous to the recursive least squares algorithm, and we develop adaptation rules for blind and semiblind frequency domain equalizers for sccp receivers. simulations of the proposed algorithms show an order of magnitude improvement in convergence speed, as well as a reduced asymptotic bit error rate. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:ECE, label2:Electric motor"}

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? purpose: carbon-13 (c-13) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) has an intrinsically low nmr sensitivity that often leads to large acquisition volumes or long scan times. while the use of higher magnetic fields can overcome the sensitivity limitations, high radiofrequency (rf) power deposition associated with proton-decoupling limits the achievable gain. two-dimensional (2d) heteronuclear single quantum coherence (hsqc) mrs is a method that uses the high chemical specificity of c-13 mrs while retaining the high sensitivity of h-1 detection. due to the 2d nature of the method, proton-decoupled c-13 mr spectra can be obtained without the use of high-powered decoupling pulses. methods: a novel three-dimensional (3d) localized 2d hsqc method based on 3d steam localization is presented and implemented at 7t. the low rf power deposition of the method allows tr variation along the indirect dimension which, in combination with controlled aliasing, leads to an acceleration of 11.8 relative to a standard 2d nmr acquisition. results: artifact-free, high-quality and high-sensitivity 2d hsqc spectra were obtained for all subjects in 19 min from a small (9 ml) volume placed in the leg adipose tissue. complete proton decoupling was achieved along the indirect c-13 dimension despite the absence of broadband proton-decoupling pulses. the high chemical specificity along the indirect c-13 dimension allowed the detection of 19 unique resonances from which the lipids could be characterized in terms of saturation and omega-6/omega-3 fatty acid ratio. conclusion: it has been demonstrated that high-quality 2d hsqc nmr spectra can be acquired from human adipose tissue at 7t. the hsqc method is methodologically simple and robust and is flexible regarding trade-offs between temporal and spectral resolution. 2d hsqc has a strong potential to become a default method in natural-abundance or c-13-enriched studies of human metabolism in vivo.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? green building incentives are important to promoting green building. however, it lacks a systematic review of existing knowledge. this paper aims to elicit the common themes in studies of green building incentives through a systematic review. it is found that the common research areas into green building incentives are incentive categorisation, its effectiveness on promoting green building development, criticism of current green incentive implementation and strategies for improving green building incentives. green building incentives are categorised into external and internal incentives. the external incentive is a forced choice whereby beneficiaries are required to fulfil specified conditions or requirements before benefitting, while the internal incentive allows beneficiaries to be incentivised out of volition because of the appeal of the benefits of green buildings. the external incentives, which are largely provided by the government, are divided into financial and non-financial incentives. it is found that owners are more incentivised by non-financial incentives. in terms of effectiveness, both external and internal incentives are important instruments for promoting green building, although it is not clear which are the more effective. furthermore, the review uncovered criticisms of external green building incentives, which mainly focus on shortcomings in administering the incentives by the government. the strategies for improving green building incentives were also found, the most important of these being the need for the government to redirect its approach of providing incentives so that owners can be encouraged to pursue green building. the review findings signify the importance of the government in relation to green building incentives. further research areas that could expand the knowledge of green building incentives are also recommended.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? background: controversy exists regarding possible correlation of periodontal disease with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and ankylosing spondylitis (as). confounding factors may relate to stringency of inflammatory disease diagnosis and the effect of therapeutic intervention for ra on periodontal disease. these factors are investigated in this study. methods: forty-five individuals with documented ra (n = 15), spondyloarthropathy (n = 15), and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (cppd) (n = 15), from the hamann-todd collection of human skeletons compiled from 1912 to 1938, and 15 individuals contemporarily incorporated in the collection were examined for tooth loss, cavity occurrence, average and maximum lingual and buccal depth of space between tooth and bone, periosteal reaction, serpentine bone resorption, abscess formation, and root penetration of the bone surface and analyzed by analysis of variance. results: tooth loss was common, but actual number of teeth lost, cavity occurrence, average and maximum lingual and buccal depth of space between tooth and bone, periosteal reaction, serpentine grooving surrounding teeth (considered a sign of inflammation), abscess formation, and root exposure (penetration of bone surface) were indistinguishable among controls and individuals with ra, spondyloarthropathy, and cppd. conclusions: although many factors can affect periodontal disease, presence of inflammatory arthritis does not appear to be one of them. the implication is that dental disease was common in the general population and not necessarily associated with arthritis, at least before the advent of modern rheumatologic medications. as specific diagnosis did not affect prevalence, perhaps current prevalence controversy may relate to current intervention, a subject for further study. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Medical, label2:Ankylosing Spondylitis"}

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? introduction: traits of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (osas) such as impaired ventilatory control, craniofacial abnormalities, and concomitant cardiovascular diseases are associated with modified endothelin-1 gene (edn-1) or endothelin-receptor-subtype-a (ednra) gene. the endothelin system regulates the cardiovascular homeostasis. edn-1 interacts mainly with ednra for signal transduction. in our study we investigate associations of ednra-polymorphisms (four frequent polymorphisms with an allele frequency >5%) and osas severity. methods: three hundred ninety-three patients older than is years. of caucasian origin and with osas (ahi >5/h and daytime sleepiness) were investigated by cardiorespiratory polysomnography. in addition 58 control subjects with healthy sleep were recruited from nearly 300 volunteers. we analysed the ednra-polymorphisms e335e, h323h, g-231a and g+70c by polymerase-chain-reaction, restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism and real-time-pcr. results: carrier of the mutant g-231a allele had a significantly lower ahi (p = 0.03, or 0.53. 95% ci 0.3-0.94) when comparing patients and controls. when comparing osas severity groups without controls we could not detect significant correlations for the four investigated ednra-polymorphisms. our data confirm that bmi (p < 0.001) and male gender (p = 0.02) are significantly associated with ahi. the allele frequencies were similar. discussion: the genetic investigation of osa remains important. our control group was relatively small and we investigated 4 reasonable candidates out of more than 100 ednra-polymorphisms. the detected protective effect of the mutant g-231a allele needs further confirmation. gene based research in osas should use genome wide scan and should still consider the endothelin system.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? the prevalence of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and drug and alcohol use disorders peaks during adolescence. further, up to 50% of adult mental health disorders emerge in adolescence. during adolescence, the prefrontal cortex (pfc) undergoes dramatic structural reorganization, in which dendritic spines and synapses are refined, pruned, and stabilized. understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes should help to identify factors that influence the development of psychiatric illness. here we briefly discuss the anatomical connections of the medial and orbital prefrontal cortex (mpfc and ofc, respectively). we then present original findings suggesting that dendritic spines on deep-layer excitatory neurons in the mouse mpfc and ofc prune at different adolescent ages, with later pruning in the ofc. in parallel, we used western blotting to define levels of several cytoskeletal regulatory proteins during early, mid-, and late adolescence, focusing on tropomyosin-related kinase receptor b (trkb) and 1-integrin-containing receptors and select signaling partners. we identified regional differences in the levels of several proteins in early and midadolescence that then converged in early adulthood. we also observed age-related differences in trkb levels, both full-length and truncated isoforms, rho-kinase 2, and synaptophysin in both pfc subregions. finally, we identified changes in protein levels in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus that were distinct from those in the pfc. we conclude with a general review of the manner in which trkb- and 1-integrin-mediated signaling influences neuronal structure in the postnatal brain. elucidating the role of cytoskeletal regulatory factors throughout adolescence may identify critical mechanisms of pfc development.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? chemerin is an adipokine that regulates adipogenesis and metabolic functions of mature adipocytes mainly through the activation of chemokine-like receptor 1 (cmklr1). elevated levels of chemerin have been found in individuals with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and osteoporosis. this adipokine was identified as an inflammatory and metabolic syndrome marker. considering that the association between metabolic syndrome and bone health remains unclear, the present study aimed to clarify the role of chemerin in the pathophysiology of bone loss induced by dyslipidemia, particularly modulating osteoclastogenesis. in vitro analyses showed a downregulation of cmklr1 at the early stage of differentiation and a gradual increase at late stages. strikingly, chemerin did not modify osteoclast differentiation markers or osteoclast formation; however, it increased the actin-ring formation and bone resorption activity in mature osteoclasts. the increased bone resorption activity induced by chemerin was effectively inhibited by cmklr1 antagonist (ccx832). chemerin boosting mature osteoclast activity involves erk5 phosphorylation. moreover, two models of dyslipidemia (high-fat diet [hfd]-treated c57/bl6 and db/db mice) exhibited significantly increased level of chemerin in the serum and gingival tissue. morphometric analysis showed that hfd-treated and db/db mice exhibited increased alveolar bone loss compared to respective control mice, which was associated with an up-regulation of chemerin, cmklr1 and cathepsin k mrna expression in the gingival tissue. the treatment of db/db mice with ccx832 effectively inhibited bone loss. antagonism of chemerin receptor also inhibited the expression of cathepsin k in the gingival tissue. our results show that chemerin not only increases osteoclasts activity in vitro, but also that increased level of chemerin in dyslipidemic mice plays a critical role in bone homeostasis.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? despite considerable interest in understanding how stress influences memory accuracy and errors, particularly in children, methodological limitations have made it difficult to examine the effects of stress independent of the effects of the emotional valence of to-be-remembered information in developmental populations. in this study, we manipulated stress levels in 7-8- and 12-14-year-olds and then exposed them to negative, neutral, and positive word lists. shortly afterward, we tested their recognition memory for the words and false memory for non-presented but related words. adolescents in the high-stress condition were more accurate than those in the low-stress condition, while children 's accuracy did not differ across stress conditions. also, among adolescents, accuracy and errors were higher for the negative than positive words, while in children, word valence was unrelated to accuracy. finally, increases in children 's and adolescents' cortisol responses, especially in the high-stress condition, were related to greater accuracy but not false memories and only for positive emotional words. findings suggest that stress at encoding, as well as the emotional content of to-be-remembered information, may influence memory in different ways across development, highlighting the need for greater complexity in existing models of true and false memory formation. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Psychology, label2:False memories"}
{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? unmanned aerial vehicles (uav) are gaining popularity due to their application in military, private, and public sector, especially being attractive for fields where human operator is not required. light-weight uavs are more desirable as they have better performance in terms of shorter take-off range and longer flight endurance. however, light weight structures with complex inner features are hard to fabricate using conventional manufacturing methods. the ability to print complex inner structures directly without the need of a mould gives additive manufacturing (am) an edge over conventional manufacturing. recent development in composite and multi-material printing opens up new possibilities of printing lightweight structures and novel platforms like flapping wings with ease. this paper explores the impact of additive manufacturing on aerodynamics, structures and materials used for uav5. the review will discuss state-of-the-art am technologies for uavs through innovations in materials and structures and their advantages and limitations. the role of additive manufacturing to improve the performance of uavs through smart material actuators and multi-functional structures will also be discussed.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? mushrooms are well known for their immunomodulating capacities. however, little is known about how mushroom-stimulated dendritic cells (dcs) affect t cells. therefore, we investigated the effect of mushroom compounds derived from seven edible mushroom species on dcs, their fate in dcs, and the effect of the mushroom-stimulated dcs on t cells. each mushroom species stimulated dcs in a different manner as was revealed from the dc 's cytokine response. assessing dc maturation revealed that only one mushroom species, agaricus subrufescens, induced complete dc maturation. the other six mushroom species upregulated mhc-ii and cd86 expression, but did not significantly affect the expression of cd40 and cd11c. nevertheless, mushroom compounds of all investigated mushroom species are endocytosed by dcs. endocytosis is most likely mediated by c-type lectin receptors (clrs) because clr binding is ca2+ dependent, and egta reduces tnf-alpha secretion with more than 90%. laminarin partly inhibited tnf-alpha secretion indicating that the clr dectin-1, among other clrs, is involved in binding mushroom compounds. stimulated dcs were shown to stimulate t cells; however, physical contact of dcs and t cells is not required. because clrs seem to play a prominent role in dc stimulation, mushrooms may function as a carbohydrate containing adjuvant to be used in conjunction with anti-fungal vaccines. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Medical, label2:Fungal Infection"}

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? the advance of massively parallel computing in the nineteen nineties and beyond encouraged finer grid intervals in numerical weather-prediction models. this has improved resolution of weather systems and enhanced the accuracy of forecasts, while setting the trend for development of unified all-scale atmospheric models. this paper first outlines the historical background to a wide range of numerical methods advanced in the process. next, the trend is illustrated with a technical review of a versatile nonoscillatory forward-in-time finite-volume (nftfv) approach, proven effective in simulations of atmospheric flows from small-scale dynamics to global circulations and climate. the outlined approach exploits the synergy of two specific ingredients: the mpdata methods for the simulation of fluid flows based on the sign-preserving properties of upstream differencing; and the flexible finite-volume median-dual unstructured-mesh discretisation of the spatial differential operators comprising pdes of atmospheric dynamics. the paper consolidates the concepts leading to a family of generalised nonhydrostatic nftfv flow solvers that include soundproof pdes of incompressible boussinesq, anelastic and pseudo-incompressible systems, common in large-eddy simulation of small-and meso-scale dynamics, as well as all-scale compressible euler equations. such a framework naturally extends predictive skills of large-eddy simulation to the global atmosphere, providing a bottom-up alternative to the reverse approach pursued in the weather-prediction models. theoretical considerations are substantiated by calculations attesting to the versatility and efficacy of the nftfv approach. some prospective developments are also discussed.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? the local binary pattern (lbp) is a simple and efficient texture descriptor for image processing. recently, lbp has been introduced for feature extraction of hyperspectral imagery. specifically, the lbp codes are extracted from the 2-d band images to capture the spatial correlation among neighboring pixels, and then the statistical histogram features from all bands, which could estimate the underlying distribution in local area, are concatenated together for pixel-wise classification. however, since hyperspectral imagery contains rich spectral and spatial information, which is actually a 3-d data cube, the 2-d lbp (2-dlbp) model cannot fully exploit the joint spectral-spatial structure. in this paper, the 2-dlbp has been extended into 3-d lbp (3-dlbp) model through forming a 3-d regular octahedral frame to characterize the spectral-spatial relationship. in order to reflect the local continuous property of hyperspectral data in both the spectral and spatial domains, while ensuring the rotational invariance of the 3-dlbp model, the code patterns of 3-dlbp model have been divided into eight groups (including seven groups of \"\"dense\"\" patterns and one group of \"\"nondense\"\" patterns) based on the consistency of spectral-spatial topology structure. specifically, the patterns in seven \"\"dense\"\" groups correspond to the microstructures in the 3-d domains (such as spots, edges, and flat areas), which has a high percentage in all the 3-dlbp patterns, while the rest patterns are aggregated and treated as the \"\"nondense\"\" patterns. the proposed method is thus called 3-d dense lbp (3-(dlbp)-l-2) model. moreover, instead of taking zero as the hard threshold, a slack variable has been introduced to enable the difference between the central pixel and the neighboring ones varying in a small interval, which could greatly decrease the impact of spectral variability and noise, and the discriminative power of the features has been further boosted. the slack threshold-based 3-(dlbp)-l-2 model is named st-3-(dlbp)-l-2. a series of experiments is conducted on three real hyperspectral imageries to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two 3-(dlbp)-l-2-based methods. the experimental results show that the performance of the proposed st-3-(dlbp)-l-2 is significantly superior to that of 2-dlbp, which is also better than the 3-(dlbp)-l-2 model and several state-of-the-art hyperspectral classification methods. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:CS, label2:Image processing"}

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? wetlands have the ability to accumulate large amounts of carbon (c), and therefore wetland restoration has been proposed as a means of sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide (co2) to help mitigate climate change. there is a growing interest in using the c services of wetlands to help reduce habitat loss and finance restoration projects. however, including wetlands in c markets worldwide requires a better mechanistic understanding of co2 and methane exchange and instruments and models that can accurately and inexpensively monitor and predict these fluxes across global wetlands. remote sensing technology, including near-surface and satellite instruments/approaches, is an effective tool for modeling c fluxes including gross primary productivity (gpp) from the site to global scale. in this study, we evaluate the potential of using digital cameras as a simple, cost-effective means of estimating gpp in restored wetlands, and assess the suitability of using landsat data to model gpp in these environments for regional upscaling. our research focused on restored temperate freshwater marshes due to their high c sequestration potential. as observed in other ecosystems, daily gpp was strongly correlated with site greenness derived from camera imagery (gcc(cam)). based on this, we show the potential of using gcccam and eddy covariance data to adapt and parameterize a light use efficiency (lue) model to predict daily gpp. the lue model combining gcccam and meteorological data was able to explain up to 91% of the variation in daily gpp at the restored marshes, and predict annual gpp budgets within 0% to 20% of observed budgets. however, model performance decreased with increasing site complexity, highlighting the need to explicitly consider spatial heterogeneity in lue models. we also tested a similar model using landsat-derived indices, and found that although model performance was high at a homogeneous wetland dominated by emergent vegetation, data-model agreement decreased at a site comprised of a mixture of open water and vegetation, reflecting limitations of landsat data. nonetheless, we show that digital camera and land sat imagery can be used to model photosynthesis in restored wetlands, providing low-cost methods for monitoring c capture that can be used in c market-funded wetland conservation and restoration.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? background: many immigrant and ethno-cultural groups in canada face substantial barriers to accessing health care including language barriers. the negative consequences of miscommunication in health care settings are well documented although there has been little research on communication barriers facing immigrant women seeking maternity care in canada. this study identified the nature of communication difficulties in maternity services from the perspectives of immigrant women, health care providers and social service providers in a small city in southern alberta, canada. methods: a focused ethnography was undertaken incorporating interviews with 31 participants recruited using purposive and snowball sampling. a community liaison and several gatekeepers within the community assisted with recruitment and interpretation where needed (n=1). all interviews were recorded and audio files were transcribed verbatim by a professional transcriptionist. the data was analysed drawing upon principles expounded by roper and shapira (2000) for the analysis of ethnographic data, because of (1) the relevance to ethnographic data, (2) the clarity and transparency of the approach, (3) the systematic approach to analysis, and (4) the compatibility of the approach with computer assisted qualitative analysis software programs such as atlas.ti (atlas ti scientific software development gmbh, germany). this process included (1) coding for descriptive labels, (2) sorting for patterns, (3) identification of outliers, (4) generation of themes, (5) generalising to generate constructs and theories, and (6) memoing including researcher reflections. findings: four main themes were identified including verbal communication, unshared meaning, nonverbal communication to build relationships, and trauma, culture and open communication. communication difficulties extended beyond matters of language competency to those encompassing nonverbal communication and its relation to shared meaning as well as the interplay of underlying pre migration history and cultural factors which affect open communication, accessible health care and perhaps also maternal outcomes. conclusion: this study provided insights regarding maternity health care communication. communication challenges may be experienced by all parties, yet the onus remains for health care providers and for those within health care management and professional bodies to ensure that providers are equipped with the skills necessary to facilitate culturally appropriate care.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? reduced amplitude of the p300 event-related potential has been consistently associated with a variety of externalising problems, including conduct disorder. the few available genetically-informative studies of these relationships, however, were conducted among adolescents/adults (i.e., at an age when conduct disorder has typically already become manifest). among 200 general population twins with a mean age of 9 years (range 6-14 years), we studied the relationship between the p300 waveform elicited by an auditory oddball task and the dsm-oriented conduct problems scale of the child behavior checklist 6-18. conduct problems scores were negatively and significantly correlated (r = -0.19, p = 0.01) with p300 amplitude; correlations between p300 amplitude and the other dsm-oriented child behavior checklist scales were non-significant, except for oppositional defiant problems (p = 0.01). we found moderate heritability estimates for both p300 amplitude (0.58, ci:0.37;0.73) and conduct problems (0.52, ci:0.25;0.70). bivariate twin analyses indicated that the covariation between these two phenotypes can be explained by additive genetic factors only, with a genetic correlation of -0.33. an association between reduced p300 amplitude and conduct problems can be substantiated already in childhood, at an age that precedes the most typical onset of conduct disorder. this relationship appears to be genetic in nature. reduced p300 amplitude can represent a valuable marker for conduct problems, and can contribute to the early identification of children at high-risk for conduct disorder. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Psychology, label2:Antisocial personality disorder"}
