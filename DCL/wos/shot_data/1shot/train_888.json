{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? in this paper, we introduce a novel three-dimensional (3d) reconstruction framework for ultrasound images using a piecewise smooth markov random field (mrf) model from irregularly spaced b-scan images obtained by freehand scanning. freehand 3d ultrasound imaging is a useful system for various clinical applications, including image-guided surgeries and interventions, as well as diagnoses, due to the variety of its scan ranges and relatively low cost. the reconstruction process performs a key role in this system because its sampling irregularities may cause undesired artifacts, and ultrasound images generally suffer from noise and distortions. however, traditional approaches are based on simple geometric interpolations, such as pixel-based or distance-weighted methods, which are sensitive to sampling density and speckle noise. these approaches generally have an additional limitation of smoothing objects boundaries. to reduce speckle noise and preserve boundaries, we devised a piecewise smooth (ps) mrf model and developed its optimization algorithm. in our framework, we can easily apply an individual noise level for each image pixel, which is specified by the characteristics of an ultrasound probe, and possibly, the lateral and axial positions of an image. as a result, the reconstructed volume has sharp object boundaries with reduced speckle noise and artifacts. our ps-mrf model provides simple segmentation results within a reconstruction framework that is useful for various purposes, such as clear visualization. the corresponding optimization methods have also been developed, and we tested a virtual phantom and a physical phantom model. experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of interpolation and segmentation accuracy. with this method, all computations can be performed with practical time consumption and with an appropriate resolution, via parallel computing using graphic processing units.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? lactobacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacterium commonly found on fruits and vegetables and also used in a variety of food fermentations. strains from this species are also regularly reported as having anti fungal or probiotic activity. genotyping methods can be used to differentiate strains of the same species thus determining if strains are related or not. however for l plantarum, the currently used methods have limitations including dna band profile interpretation difficulty and cost. in this study, a new genotyping method based on multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (mlva) was developed and compared to a previously reported randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) method for l plantarum. with a selection of 13 antifungal strains of l plantarum isolated from heterogeneous sources (cheese, silage, sauerkraut, vegetables and a probiotic product), rapd-pcr revealed 9 different profiles resulting in a hunter-gaston discrimination index (d-value) of 0.94. the new mlva method which compares the lengths of 4 repetitive regions within lpxtg motif-containing surface protein genes differentiated the 13 l plantarum strains into 10 different subtypes leading to a d-value of 0.95. interestingly 11 additional l. plantarum isolates obtained in a previous study during a screen for antifungal activity against the common cheese spoilage mould penicillium commune all possessed the same rapd-pcr and mlva profile as each other and the commercial probiotic strain l. plantarum 299v. this study demonstrates that the new mlva method can be used to simply and inexpensively differentiate l plantarum strains and provide information regarding strain relatedness and thus potential insight into strain properties.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? the discovery of noncoding rnas (ncrnas) and their importance for gene regulation led us to develop bioinformatics tools to pursue the discovery of novel ncrnas. finding ncrnas de novo is challenging, first due to the difficulty of retrieving large numbers of sequences for given gene activities, and second due to exponential demands on calculation needed for comparative genomics on a large scale. recently, several tools for the prediction of conserved rna secondary structure were developed, but many of them are not designed to uncover new ncrnas, or are too slow for conducting analyses on a large scale. here we present various approaches using the database ribogap as a primary tool for finding known ncrnas and for uncovering simple sequence motifs with regulatory roles. this database also can be used to easily extract intergenic sequences of eubacteria and archaea to find conserved rna structures upstream of given genes. we also show how to extend analysis further to choose the best candidate ncrnas for experimental validation.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? using data from two measurement networks, we analyse the following aspects of wind speeds over switzerland to assess the possibility of high wind power penetration: spatial correlation, persistent low wind power conditions and the diurnal and seasonal wind speed patterns. we show that correlation amongst speeds as a function of distance is significantly lower compared to values found in literature. this can be attributed to the complex terrain of the alps, which has a profound influence on meteorological parameters. secondly, using extreme value analysis we calculate return levels for low wind power periods. large differences are found, with return levels ranging from 29 to 1017 h of no power production for a return period of 10 years. no clear spatial pattern was found that can account for these values. however, the length of no-production periods decreases with increasing elevation. next, we investigate diurnal and seasonal wind speed patterns and show how the different patterns and their intra-annual variation can be explained by local topography. we also find that with increasing elevation mean wind speeds and power production increase, even when accounting for lower air density. wind speeds are on average higher in winter, and at elevation the relative increase in winter compared to summer is higher. notable exceptions are explained from topography and carry implications for wind power development. in view of switzerland 's electricity shortage in winter, these findings make a strong claim for wind power development, especially at higher elevations.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? ochratoxin a (ota) is a mycotoxin, or fungal toxin, that contaminates multiple foodstuffs worldwide. affected commodities include oats, wheat, maize, barley, raisins and other dried vine fruits, wine, beer, coffee, and cocoa. although ota has been shown to cause kidney disease, including kidney cancer, in multiple animal species, the impact of dietary ota on human health from a global perspective has been less clear. several epidemiological studies suggest an association between ota exposure and human kidney disease, but evidence of causality has been limited. nonetheless, because ota is common in so many foodstuffs and may play a role in kidney disease, we consider it important to improve the body of evidence surrounding ota 's adverse effects to humans, as well as human dietary exposures in different parts of the world. this is especially true in the light of increasing type 2 diabetes and obesity prevalence worldwide; both conditions frequently lead to chronic kidney disease (ckd), and may synergize with dietary ota exposure to increase ckd risk.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? background. sports medicine has matured as a focused discipline within primary care with the number of primary care sports medicine physicians growing annually. the practices of these physicians range from ''part-time'' sports medicine as a part of a broader practice in their primary specialty, to functioning as a full-time team physician for a university or college. managed care organizations are increasingly incorporating primary care sports medicine providers into their organizations. the optimal role of these providers in a managed care system has not been described. methods. a descriptive analysis was made of patient contacts in a referral-based, free-standing primary care sports medicine clinic associated with a large managed care system. this study describes patient information including demographic data, referral source, primary diagnosis, specialized diagnostic testing, and subsequent specialty consultation. results. a total of 1857 patient contacts were analyzed. new patients were referred from a full range of physicians both primary care (family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, and emergency physicians) and other specialists, with family practice clinic providers (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) accounting for the largest percentage of new referrals. the majority of patient visits were for orthopedic injuries (95.4%); the most frequently involved injury sites were: knee (26.5%), shoulder (18.2%), back (14.3%), and ankle (10%). the most common types of injury were: tendinitis (21.3%), chronic anterior knee pain (10.6%), and ligament sprains (9.9%). specialized testing was requested for 8% of all patients. the majority of patients were treated at the ft belvoir sports medicine clinic by primary care sports medicine physicians without further specialty referral, conclusions. primary care sports medicine physicians offer an intermediate level of care for patients while maintaining a practice in their primary care specialty. this dual practice is ideal in the managed care setting. this study demonstrates the complementary nature of primary care sports medicine and orthopedics, with the primary care sports medicine physician reducing the demand on orthopedists for nonsurgical treatment, this study also demonstrates the need for revision in the orthopedic curriculum for primary care physicians. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Medical, label2:Sprains and Strains"}
{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? background: despite several polysomnographic studies on periodic leg movements (plm) in healthy sleep, data on the prevalence and characteristics of periodic arm movements (pam) in normal subjects are lacking. we aimed to investigate pam and their association with plm during wakefulness and sleep in healthy subjects. methods: ninety-one participants underwent video-polysomnography according to american academy of sleep medicine 2007 criteria. in addition to standard electromyographic registration, data for both flexor digitorum superficialis muscles were recorded. results: sixty-two subjects (68.1%) had a pam index during wakefulness >5/h (median pam index during wakefulness, 8.8/h; range, 0-77). seven subjects (7.7%) had a pam index >5/h during sleep (median pam index during sleep, 0.7/h; range, 0-47.4). in 14% of cases, pam during wakefulness were coincident with plm during wakefulness. during sleep, this coincidence was not evident. the correlation between pam and plm was weak to moderate (during wakefulness: spearman 's rho = 0.576, p < 0.001; during sleep: spearman 's rho = 0.222, p = 0.036). conclusion: in healthy subjects, pam occur predominantly during wakefulness with no apparent true periodicity. in contrast to classical plm, some pam may not present a true periodic phenomenon, but rather random voluntary movements meeting the wide range of periodicity criteria for plm.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? background and purpose: atypical parkinsonian disorders (apd) frequently overlap in clinical presentations, making the differential diagnosis challenging in the early stages. the present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the [f-18]fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography statistical parametric mapping (spm) optimized procedure in supporting the early and differential diagnosis of apd. methods: seventy patients with possible apd were retrospectively included from a large clinical cohort. the included patients underwent [f-18]fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography within 3 months of the first clinical assessment and a diagnostic follow-up. an optimized spm voxel-wise procedure was used to produce t-maps of brain hypometabolism in single subjects, which were classified by experts blinded to any clinical information. we compared the accuracy of both the first clinical diagnosis and the spm t-map classifications with the diagnosis at follow-up as the reference standard. results: at first diagnosis, 60% of patients were classified as possible apd (progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy) and about 40% as apd with uncertain diagnosis, providing 52% sensitivity, 97% specificity and 86% accuracy with respect to the reference standard. spm t-map classification showed 98% sensitivity, 99% specificity and 99% accuracy, and a significant agreement with the diagnosis at follow-up (p < 0.001). conclusions: the spm t-map classification at entry predicted the second diagnosis at follow-up. this indicates its significantly superior role for an early identification of apd subtypes, particularly in cases of uncertain diagnosis. the use of a metabolic biomarker at entry in the instrumental work-up of apd may shorten the diagnostic time, producing benefits for treatment options and support to the patients. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Medical, label2:Dementia"}
{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? background: previous studies showed that md is associated with a variety of cognitive deficits and executive dysfunctions which can persist even in remitted states. however, the role of cognitive impairments in md psychopathology and treatment is not fully understood. this article aims to discuss how executive functions central components (e.g., working memory and attention) mediate md psychopathology considering the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc) and present findings of a brain stimulation experiment to support this notion. methods: the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tdcs) of the dlpfc on enhancing cognitive control functions was investigated. twenty-four patients with md (experimental group=12, control group=12) received 10 sessions of tdcs (2 ma for 30 min) over 10 consecutive days. the experimental group received active stimulation and the control group received sham stimulation. participant 's performance on cognitive functions (pal, srm, rvp and crt from cantab) and their depression scores were assessed before and after tdcs. results: results showed that brain stimulation of the dlpfc improved executive dysfunction in patients and a significant improvement on depression scores was also observed suggesting that cognitive control dysfunction may be a mediator in emotional dysregulation and psychopathology of md. limitations: no follow-up investigation was done in this study which does not allow to infer long-term effect of tdcs. low-focality of tdcs might have stimulated adjacent areas too. conclusion: cognitive components, namely cognitive control dysfunction, play role in md psychopathology as they are involved in emotion dysregulation in md. the amount of contribution of cognitive components in md psychopathology is however, an open question. tdcs can be used as an intervention to improve cognitive dysfunction in md. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Medical, label2:Bipolar Disorder"}

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? context: any newcomer or industrial practitioner is likely to experience difficulties in digesting large volumes of knowledge in software testing. in an ideal world, all knowledge used in industry, education and research should be based on high-quality evidence. since no decision should be made based on a single study, secondary studies become essential in presenting the evidence. according to our search, over 101 secondary studies have been published in the area of software testing since 1994. with this high number of secondary studies, it is important to conduct a review in this area to provide an overview of the research landscape in this area. objective: the goal of this study is to systematically map (classify) the secondary studies in software testing. we propose that tertiary studies can serve as summarizing indexes which facilitate finding the most relevant information from secondary studies and thus supporting evidence-based decision making in any given area of software engineering. our research questions (rqs) investigate: (1) software-testing specific areas, (2) types of rqs investigated, (3) numbers and trends, and (4) citations of the secondary studies. method: to conduct the tertiary study, we use the systematic-mapping approach. additionally, we contrast the testing topics to the number of google hits to address a general popularity of a testing topic and study the most popular papers in terms of citations. we furthermore demonstrate the practicality and usefulness of our results by mapping them to istqb foundation syllabus and to swebok to provide implications for practitioners, testing educators, and researchers. results: after a systematic search and voting process, our study pool included 101 secondary studies in the area of software testing between 1994 and 2015. among our results are the following: (1) in terms of number of secondary studies, model-based approach is the most popular testing method, web services are the most popular system under test (sut), while regression testing is the most popular testing phase; (2) the quality of secondary studies, as measured by a criteria set established in the community, is slowly increasing as the years go by; and (3) analysis of research questions, raised and studied in the pool of secondary studies, showed that there is a lack of 'causality' and 'relationship' type of research questions, a situation which needs to be improved if we, as a community, want to advance as a scientific field. (4) among secondary studies, we found that regular surveys receive significantly more citations than sms (p = 0.009) and slrs (p = 0.014). conclusion: despite the large number of secondary studies, we found that many important areas of software testing currently lack secondary studies, e.g., test management, role of product risk in testing, human factors in software testing, beta-testing (a/b-testing), exploratory testing,. testability, test stopping criteria, and test-environment development. having secondary studies in those areas is important for satisfying industrial and educational needs in software testing. on the other hand, education material of istqb foundation syllabus and swebok could benefit from the inclusion of the latest research topics, namely search-based testing, use of cloud-computing for testing and symbolic execution.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? spreading depolarizations occur spontaneously and frequently in injured human brain. they propagate slowly through injured tissue often cycling around a local area of damage. tissue recovery after an spreading depolarization requires greatly augmented energy utilisation to normalise ionic gradients from a virtually complete loss of membrane potential. in the injured brain, this is difficult because local blood flow is often low and unreactive. in this study, we use a new variant of microdialysis, continuous on-line microdialysis, to observe the effects of spreading depolarizations on brain metabolism. the neurochemical changes are dynamic and take place on the timescale of the passage of an spreading depolarization past the microdialysis probe. dialysate potassium levels provide an ionic correlate of cellular depolarization and show a clear transient increase. dialysate glucose levels reflect a balance between local tissue glucose supply and utilisation. these show a clear transient decrease of variable magnitude and duration. dialysate lactate levels indicate non-oxidative metabolism of glucose and show a transient increase. preliminary data suggest that the transient changes recover more slowly after the passage of a sequence of multiple spreading depolarizations giving rise to a decrease in basal dialysate glucose and an increase in basal dialysate potassium and lactate levels. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Medical, label2:Atrial Fibrillation"}

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? a host of mining practices produce fine-grained mineral sludge, such as mature fine tailing from oil-sand extraction. these sludges are hard to dewater because of their high clay content and their low hydraulic conductivity. this paper describes pressure filtration tests in which eight different nonwoven geotextiles (gtxs) were used to filter high-clay-content sludges. the sludges were formulated by mixing kaolinite and silt to obtain eight different grain-size distributions (gsds) with d(50) ranging from 3 to 55 mu m and clay content ranging from 0% to 38% (d < 2 mu m). the sludges created for this research had the gsd and variability of real fine tailings. the results indicate that sludges can be filtered with nonwoven gtxs selected on the basis of their pore-opening size. furthermore, calendered gtxs are more efficient in retaining particles than needle punched gtxs. in addition, only during the early stage of filtration do gtxs really influence filtering because it is at this stage that, by retaining coarser particles, they allow progressive formation of filter cake. upon forming, the filter cake becomes the major contributor to particle retention. finally, the sludge composition is found to be the most significant factor affecting the final state of dewatering.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? suitable maintenance, rehabilitation, and repair methods for long-span bridges should be decided based on their purposes as evaluated by carrying out close inspection and observation. this study deals with a rehabilitation method, its applicability to a long-span bridge with a fatigue crack in the stinger-bearing connection plate. replacing line type contact bearing systems with pot bearings was proposed as the rehabilitation method to stop fatigue cracking, reduce local stress of the fatigue-cracked connection plates, and improve the structural behaviors of the main suspension bridge members. thus, a stringer-bearing connection specimen was fabricated; then, gouging and bracket installation were simulated for replacing a deteriorated bearing system with a new bearing system. from the results of the gouging and bracket-installation test, the applicability of the rehabilitation method for change works was verified. in addition, the structural responses of the loading tests were compared with those of a finite element analysis in terms of changes in bearing conditions. the deformations of the stringer and the end-beam improved, and local stress and displacement in the fatigue-cracked connection plate were reduced owing to the bearing system replacement. therefore, replacement of the bearing system can improve the stress level and stop further fatigue cracking in fatigue-cracked connection plates of suspension bridges. in addition, these results can provide basic information about the rehabilitation method involving replacing the bearing systems of bridges with line type contact bearings.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? facial landmark detection is an important issue in many computer vision applications about faces. it is very challenging as human faces in wild conditions often present large variations in shape due to different poses, occlusions or expressions. deep neural networks have been applied to learn the map from face images to face shapes. to the best of our knowledge, recurrent neural network (rnn) has not been used in this issue yet. in this paper, we propose a method which utilizes rnn and deep neural network (dnn) to learn the face shape. first, we build a global network using long short term memory (lstm) architecture of rnn to get the initial landmark estimation of faces. then, we use feed-forward neural networks for local search where a component-based searching method is explored. by using lstm-rnn, the initial estimation is more reliable which makes the following component-based search feasible and accurate. experiments show that the global network using lstm-rnn gets better results than previous networks in both videos and single image. our method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms especially in terms of fine estimation of landmarks.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? previous studies have shown that estrogen regulates bone homeostasis through regulatory effects on oxidative stress. however, it is unclear how estrogen deficiency triggers reactive oxygen species (ros) accumulation. recent studies provide evidence that the b lymphoma mo-mlv insertion region 1 (bmi-1) plays a critical role in protection against oxidative stress and that this gene is directly regulated by estrogen via estrogen receptor (er) at the transcriptional level. in this study, ovariectomized mice were given drinking water with/without antioxidant n-acetyl-cysteine (nac, 1mg/ml) supplementation, and compared with each other and with sham mice. results showed that ovariectomy resulted in bone loss with increased osteoclast surface, increased ros levels, t cell activation, and increased tnf and rankl levels in serum and in cd4 t cells; nac supplementation largely prevented these alterations. bmi-1 expression levels were dramatically downregulated in cd4 t cells from ovariectomized mice. we supplemented drinking water to bmi-1-deficient mice with/without nac and compared them with each other and with wild-type (wt) mice. we found that bmi-1 deficiency mimicked alterations observed in ovariectomy whereas nac supplementation reversed all alterations induced by bmi-1 deficiency. because t cells are critical in mediating ovariectomy-induced bone loss, we further assessed whether bmi-1 overexpression in lymphocytes can protect against estrogen deficiency-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone loss by inhibiting oxidative stress, t cell activation, and rankl production. when wt and e-bmi-1 transgenic mice with bmi-1 specifically overexpressed in lymphocytes were ovariectomized and compared with each other and with wt sham mice, we found that bmi-1 overexpression in lymphocytes clearly reversed all alterations induced by ovariectomy. results from this study indicate that estrogen deficiency downregulates bmi-1 and subsequently increases ros, t cell activation, and rankl production in t cells, thus enhancing osteoclastogenesis and accelerating bone loss. this study clarifies a novel mechanism regulating estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? background: vertically oriented global health initiatives (ghis) addressing the hiv/aids epidemic, including the president 's emergency plan for aids relief (pepfar), have successfully contributed to reducing hiv/aids related morbidity and mortality. however, there is still debate about whether these disease-specific programs have improved or harmed health systems overall, especially with respect to non-hiv health needs. methods: as part of a larger evaluation of pepfar 's effects on the health system between 2005-2011, we collected qualitative and quantitative data through semi-structured interviews with district health officers (dhos) from all 112 districts in uganda. we asked dhos to share their perceptions about the ways in which hiv programs (largely pepfar in the ugandan context) had helped and harmed the health system. we then identified key themes among their responses using qualitative content analysis. results: ugandan dhos said pepfar had generally helped the health system by improving training, integrating hiv and non-hiv care, and directly providing resources. to a lesser extent, dhos said pepfar caused the health system to focus too narrowly on hiv/aids, increased workload for already overburdened staff, and encouraged doctors to leave public sector jobs for higher-paid positions with hiv/aids programs. conclusion: health system leaders in uganda at the district level were appreciative of resources aimed at hiv they could often apply for broader purposes. as hiv infection becomes a chronic disease requiring strong health systems to manage sustained patient care over time, uganda 's weak health systems will require broad infrastructure improvements inconsistent with narrow vertical health programming. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Medical, label2:HIV/AIDS"}

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? difficulty in emotion regulation is a hallmark feature of patients with borderline personality disorder (bpd). skills training concepts based on dialectical-behaviour therapy (dbt) are common and effective treatment options for specifically addressing lacking skills in emotion regulation. however, so far it is unclear which aspects of coping change over the course of dbt skills training and if these coping strategies predict symptom change. the present process-outcome analysis, based on a randomized controlled study, aims at investigating these questions, by referring to a general conception of coping and by using an observer-rated approach to assess coping strategies directly in the therapy sessions. in total, n=31 patients with bpd underwent two individual clinical interview assessments (pre- and post-study intervention; half of the patients underwent dbt skills training, half were in a wait-list control). all individual assessment sessions were transcribed and analysed using the coping action pattern rating scale. outcome was assessed pre- and post-intervention using the outcome questionnaire-45.2 and the borderline symptom list 23. the results showed increase in overall coping functioning in patients who underwent the dbt skills training, compared with the controls, and specific increases in relatedness coping where the stress is appraised as challenge, along with specific decreases in autonomy coping where the stress is appraised as threat. these changes predicted changes in general distress and borderline symptomatology. the results are interpreted within a general framework aiming at understanding the psychological effects of treatments for bpd, in particular effects related to coping. effective emotion regulation strategies may therefore be important candidates as potential change mechanisms in treatments for bpd. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Psychology, label2:Borderline personality disorder"}
{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? introduction: telehealth has been widely promoted as a technology to make healthcare more effective and affordable. however, current telehealth systems suffer from vendor lock-in and high cost, and are designed for managing chronic diseases rather than preventing them. methods: we address shortcomings of existing consumer-level health informatics applications in supporting senior health consumers, and provide designers of such systems with a design framework. we assess the feasibility of patient-centred health management systems (hmss) that are designed based on the proposed framework. in contrast to traditional telehealth, hmss are patient centred and aim at enabling health consumers to take control of their own health by providing functionality for health self-management. quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted in evaluating a prototype hms. results: senior healthcare consumers viewed our hms prototype positively, and experienced a positive change in their attitude towards their health. we identified requirements and challenges for hmss. in particular, participants indicated that social networking features must have a clear purpose beyond simple broadcasting of emotions and opinions. discussion: our study indicates that seniors are able and motivated to leverage a web-based patient-centred hms, provided that there are suitable health support applications tailored to their needs. this could be achieved by making it attractive for third party application developers to contribute hms content. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Medical, label2:Senior Health"}

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? human -defensin 3 (hbd3) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide with potent bactericidal activity in vitro. hbd3 is produced in response to pathogen challenge and can modulate immune responses. the amplified recognition of self-dna by human plasmacytoid dendritic cells has been previously reported, but we show here that hbd3 preferentially enhances the response to bacterial dna in mouse flt-3 induced dendritic cells (fldcs) and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. we show the effect is mediated through tlr9 and although hbd3 significantly increases the cellular uptake of both e. coli and self-dna in mouse fldcs, only the response to bacterial dna is enhanced. liposome transfection also increases uptake of bacterial dna and amplifies the tlr9-dependent response. in contrast to hbd3, lipofection of self-dna enhances inflammatory signaling, but the response is predominantly tlr9-independent. together, these data show that hbd3 has a role in the innate immune-mediated response to pathogen dna, increasing inflammatory signaling and promoting activation of the adaptive immune system via antigen presenting cells including dendritic cells. therefore, our data identify an additional immunomodulatory role for this copy-number variable defensin, of relevance to host defence against infection and indicate a potential for the inclusion of hbd3 in pathogen dna-based vaccines. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:Medical, label2:Psoriasis"}

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? behavioral weight loss (bwl) treatments result in suboptimal weight losses for many individuals. impulsivity appears to be a maintenance factor of obesity, yet few studies have examined impulsivity as a predictor of outcomes from bwl. we examined specific facets of impulsivity (inhibitory control and delay discounting) as moderators of outcome in bwl. overweight adults (n = 190) were randomized to standard behavioral treatment (sbt) or acceptance-based behavioral treatment (abt). we hypothesized that impulsivity would be inversely associated with weight loss, and that the association between impulsivity and outcome would be attenuated in the abt condition. poorer general inhibitory control predicted lower percent weight lost at 12 months across conditions at the trend level (b = -0.003, p = 0.06). the negative impact of low inhibitory control on weight loss was attenuated by assignment to abt versus sbt (b = 0.004, p = 0.03). treatment condition, at trend level, also moderated the impact of delay discounting (b = -0.011, p =.098) and food-specific inhibitory control (b = 0.003, p = 0.06) on percent weight loss such that those with greater impulsivity benefitted most from abt. results reveal a potential pattern that impulsivity reduces benefit derived from sbt but not abt. further research on the moderating effect of impulsivity is necessary to inform the development of targeted treatments for clinically meaningful subtypes of patients.

{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? the purpose of this study is to propose a novel differential protection scheme for dc-ac converters. the current differential relay is widely used to protect transformers, generators, busbars and transmission lines. however, it cannot be applied to a dc-ac inverter, which is used in an ac-dc transmission line system. this paper presents a novel differential protection scheme for dc-ac converters, using tellegen 's theorem. tellegen 's theorem is a simple theorem of electric power proved from kirchhoff 's current law and kirchhoff 's voltage law. under the theorem, we define three kinds of electric power as power flow. the proposed technique is evaluated using simulation studies based on an ideal inverter circuit which transforms dc to ac. the test results show the validity of the proposed protection. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:ECE, label2:Voltage law"}
{"content": "What labels are related to these texts? magnetically levitated planar motor is a new-generation motion device in modern precision industry, while its advanced motion controller design is still of main concern. in this paper, a learning adaptive robust control (larc) motion controller is proposed for a magnetically levitated planar motor developed in our laboratory to achieve good tracking performance. the planar motor consists of a halbach permanent magnetic array as the stator, and a levitated platen containing four groups of three-phase windings as the mover. based on the lorentz force law, the mover placed in the magnetic field is subjected to vertical force for levitation and horizonal force for planar motion through dynamics decoupling and current allocation. an larc control scheme containing adaptive robust control (arc) term and iterative learning control (ilc) term in a serial structure is then proposed for the magnetically levitated planar motor to achieve high-performance tracking even there exist parametric variations and uncertain disturbances. comparative experiments between traditional lead, arc, ilc, and the proposed larc are carried out on the planar motor to track sinusoidal, point-to-point, and planar circular motions, respectively. the experimental results consistently validate that the proposed larc control strategy outperforms other controllers much, and possesses not only good transient/steady-state tracking performance but also parametric adaptation ability and uncertain disturbance robustness. the proposed scheme actually provides a practically effective technique for motion control of magnetically levitated planar motors in industrial applications. label set: CS,Medical,Psychology,Civil,ECE,biochemistry,MAE,Parallel computing,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Bioinformatics,Skin Care,Child abuse,Antisocial personality disorder,Smart Material,State space representation,Computer programming,Southern blotting,Smoking Cessation,Alzheimer's Disease,computer-aided design,Microcontroller,Electricity,Atopic Dermatitis,Immunology,False memories,Enzymology,Osteoarthritis,Image processing,Attention,Operating systems,Materials Engineering,Diabetes,Sprains and Strains,Healthy Sleep,Dementia,Bipolar Disorder,Analog signal processing,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Thermodynamics,Signal-flow graph,Media violence,Software engineering,Atrial Fibrillation,Relational databases,System identification,Cell biology,Ambient Intelligence,Depression,Eating disorders,Sports Injuries,Cryptography,Heart Disease,Geotextile,Stress Management,Water Pollution,Leadership,Solar Energy,Person perception,Children's Health,Headache,PID controller,Electric motor,Osteoporosis,Suspension Bridge,Medicare,Distributed computing,Strength of materials,Fluid mechanics,Hereditary Angioedema,Algorithm design,Northern blotting,Digital control,Internal combustion engine,Gender roles,Emergency Contraception,Multiple Sclerosis,Low Testosterone,Autism,Addiction,Green Building,network security,Hepatitis C,Computer vision,Manufacturing engineering,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Operational amplifier,Machine design,Myelofibrosis,Overactive Bladder,Electrical circuits,Computer graphics,Crohn's Disease,Lymphoma,Schizophrenia,Prenatal development,Remote Sensing,Seasonal affective disorder,Molecular biology,Hypothyroidism,Polycythemia Vera,Genetics,Parenting,Polymerase chain reaction,Menopause,Hydraulics,Parkinson's Disease,Rainwater Harvesting,Construction Management,Machine learning,Digestive Health,Social cognition,Electrical network,Anxiety,Fungal Infection,HIV/AIDS,Data structures,Problem-solving,Prosocial behavior,Allergies,Prejudice,Human Metabolism,Psoriatic Arthritis,Kidney Health,Stealth Technology,Control engineering,Asthma,Nonverbal communication,Ankylosing Spondylitis,Birth Control,Borderline personality disorder,Senior Health,Migraine,Symbolic computation,Psoriasis,Cancer,Mental Health,Weight Loss,Structured Storage,Voltage law,Lorentz force law,Electrical generator", "label": "label1:ECE, label2:Lorentz force law"}
