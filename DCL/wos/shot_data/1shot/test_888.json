{"content": "the security of cryptographic systems is a major concern for cryptosystem designers, even though cryptography algorithms have been improved. side-channel attacks, by taking advantage of physical vulnerabilities of cryptosystems, aim to gain secret information. several approaches have been proposed to analyze side-channel information, among which machine learning is known as a promising method. machine learning in terms of neural networks learns the signature (power consumption and electromagnetic emission) of an instruction, and then recognizes it automatically. in this paper, a novel experimental investigation was conducted on field-programmable gate array (fpga) implementation of elliptic curve cryptography (ecc), to explore the efficiency of side-channel information characterization based on a learning vector quantization (lvq) neural network. the main characteristics of lvq as a multi-class classifier are that it has the ability to learn complex non-linear input-output relationships, use sequential training procedures, and adapt to the data. experimental results show the performance of multi-class classification based on lvq as a powerful and promising approach of side-channel data characterization.", "label": "label1:CS, label2:Machine learning"}

{"content": "background and objectivebacteria in the dental biofilm surrounding marginal gingival grooves cause periodontal diseases. numerous bacteria within the biofilm consume nutrients from the gingival crevicular fluid. furthermore, some gram-negative bacteria in mature dental biofilms produce butyrate. thus, gingival epithelial cells in close proximity to mature dental biofilms are at risk of both starvation and exposure to butyrate. in the present study, we determined the combined effects of starvation and butyrate exposure on gingival epithelial cell death and the underlying mechanisms. material and methodsthe ca9-22 cell line was used as an in vitro counterpart of gingival epithelial cells. cell death was measured as the amount of total dna in the dead cells using sytox green dye, which penetrates through membranes of dead cells and emits fluorescence when it intercalates into double-stranded dna. amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) activity, the amount of autophagy, and acetylation of histone h3 were determined using western blot. gene expression levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3b (lc3b) were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. resultsbutyrate-induced cell death occurred in a dose-dependent manner whether cells were starved or fed. however, the induction of cell death was two to four times higher when cells were placed under starvation conditions compared to when they were fed. moreover, both starvation and butyrate exposure induced ampk activity and autophagy. while ampk inactivation resulted in decreased autophagy and butyrate-induced cell death under conditions of starvation, ampk activation resulted in butyrate-induced cell death when cells were fed. combined with the results of our previous report, which demonstrated butyrate-induced autophagy-dependent cell death, the results of this study suggest that the combination of starvation and butyrate exposure activates ampk inducing autophagy and subsequent cell death. notably, this combination markedly induced lc3b production and the induction was attenuated by ampk inhibition. lc3b knockdown, in turn, significantly decreased butyrate-induced cell death. therefore, ampk-dependent lc3b induction apparently plays an important role in butyrate-induced cell death. there was a lack of correspondence between the levels of ampk activation and lc3b induction; this may reflect the histone deacetylase-inhibitory capacity of butyrate on histone proteins. conclusiontaken together, starvation and butyrate exposure promote autophagy via ampk signaling, while the histone deacetylase-inhibitory effects of butyrate alter chromatin to transcriptionally active state, resulting in strong lc3b induction and subsequent cell death. these findings may help improve the understanding of the cellular processes underlying periodontal disease initiation.", "label": "label1:biochemistry, label2:Polymerase chain reaction"}

{"content": "background. anesthesiologists who work extended hours exhibit acute and chronic sleep deprivation. the newest bilateral bispectral index (bis)-vista monitor offers new advantages over earlier models, which include a new algorithm (version 1.4). one possible useful application for bis monitoring of physiological sleep would be in critically ill patients who almost uniformly suffer from sleep disruption and deprivation because they loose their circadian rhythm due to the harsh noisy environment of critical care units. previous studies, which used earlier versions of the bis monitor to depict normal physiologic sleep, produced widely conflicting results. the aim of our study was to assess whether the new bis-vista monitor would exhibit a temporal decline that corresponds to natural physiologic sleep stages in healthy sleep-deprived, post-call anesthesiologists. methods. bis-vista sensors were bilaterally mounted, according to the manufacturer guidelines, onto the forehead of 10 healthy sleep-deprived volunteer anesthesiologists. using the conventional rechtschaffen and kales criteria, bis values during the awake, si, s2, s3, s4, and rapid eye movement (rem) sleep stages were recorded. results. meant +/- sd bis values during the awake, si, s2, s3, s4, and rem sleep stages significantly declined for the left (96 +/- 2, 82 +/- 11, 73 +/- 10, 53 +/- 13, 43 +/- 11, 66 +/- 9) and right (97 +/- 2, 78 +/- 11, 69 +/- 9, 50 +/- 10, 39 +/- 13, 61 +/- 14) hemispheres respectively. there were no significant interhemispheric differences in bis values over time (two-way anova). however, in one subject, the left and right bis values were mostly discordant throughout the recordings. conclusion. we demonstrated that although the bis-vista monitor was neither designed nor validated for monitoring normal physiologic sleep, it depicted a temporal decline that corresponds to normal physiologic sleep stages in sleep-deprived anesthesiologists.

{"content": "objectives: although there is consensus that sex hormones modulate memory, we have an incomplete understanding of their role in remembering and forgetting. humans continuously update memory, forgetting old, out-of-date information and encoding new, more relevant information. updating processes can be studied with the list method of directed forgetting. methods: in the list method of directed forgetting task, subjects study two lists of items and, after study of list 1, are asked to either forget or remember the list for an upcoming memory test. free testosterone level was quantified from saliva samples. directed forgetting and saliva testosterone were evaluated in young men (aged between 18 and 28 years). results: following a forget cue, recall of list-1 items was reduced and recall of list-2 items was enhanced. however, only recall of list-2 items was associated with free testosterone level. following a forget cue, participants with low testosterone levels showed higher recall of list-2 items than participants with high testosterone levels. conclusion: the selective association between testosterone level and list-2 recall is consistent with two-mechanism accounts of memory updating, where the forgetting effect is due to impaired retrieval and the enhancement effect to improved encoding. on the basis of this view, the present results indicate that low testosterone levels are associated with improved binding of the newly encoded memories to their context cue.", "label": "label1:Medical, label2:Low Testosterone"}

{"content": "this paper presents the torque model of a ball-joint-like three-degree-of-freedom (3-dof) permanent magnet (pm) spherical actuator. this actuator features a ball-shaped rotor with multiple pm poles and a spherical stator with circumferential air-core coils. an analytical expression of the magnetic field of the rotor is obtained based on laplace 's equation. based on this expression and properties of air-core stator coils, lorentz force law is employed for the study of the relationship between the rotor torque and coil input currents. by using linear superposition, the expression of the actuator torque in terms of current input to the stator coils can be obtained in a matrix form. the linear expression of the actuator torque will facilitate real-time motion control of the actuator as a servo system. experimental works are carried out to measure the actual magnetic field distribution of the pm rotor in three-diamensional (3-d) space as well as to measure the actual 3-d motor torque generated by the actuator coils. the measurement results were coincident with analytical study on the rotor magnetic field distribution and actuator torque expressions. the linearity and superposition of the actuator torque were also verified through the experiments.", "label": "label1:ECE, label2:Lorentz force law"}

{"content": "a 1 kw scale kite-powered system that uses kites to convert wind energy into electrical energy has been studied to determine its performance characteristics and establish feasibility of steady-state operation. in this kite-powered system, a kite is connected to a tether that transmits the generated aerodynamic forces on the kite to a power conversion system on the ground. the ground-based power conversion system consists of a rocking arm coupled to a sprag clutch, flywheel, and electrical generator. governing equations describing the dynamical motion of the kite, tether, and power conversion mechanism were developed assuming an inflexible, straight-line tether. a steady-state analysis of the kite aerodynamics was incorporated into the dynamical equations of the kite-powered system. the governing equations were solved numerically using a runge-kutta scheme to assess how performance parameters of the system such as output power, cycle time, and tether tension varied with wind speed, kite area, and aerodynamic characteristics of the kite. the results showed that a 1 kw scale system is feasible using the proposed design concept with a kite area of 25 m(2) and wind speeds of 6 m/s. preliminary efforts to build and test a working 1 kw scale kite-powered demonstrator are also reported.

{"content": "in face of high partial and complete disk failure rates and untimely system crashes, the executions of low-priority background tasks become increasingly frequent in large-scale data centers. however, the existing algorithms are all reactive optimizations and only exploit the temporal locality of workloads to reduce the user i/o requests during the low-priority background tasks. to address the problem, this paper proposes intelligent data outsourcing (ido), a zone-based and proactive data migration optimization, to significantly improve the efficiency of the low-priority background tasks. the main idea of ido is to proactively identify the hot data zones of raid-structured storage systems in the normal operational state. by leveraging the prediction tools to identify the upcoming events, ido proactively migrates the data blocks belonging to the hot data zones on the degraded device to a surrogate raid set in the large-scale data centers. upon a disk failure or crash reboot, most user i/o requests addressed to the degraded raid set can be serviced directly by the surrogate raid set rather than the much slower degraded raid set. consequently, the performance of the background tasks and user i/o performance during the background tasks are improved simultaneously. our lightweight prototype implementation of ido and extensive trace-driven experiments on two case studies demonstrate that, compared with the existing state-of-the-art approaches, ido effectively improves the performance of the low-priority background tasks. moreover, ido is portable and can be easily incorporated into any existing algorithms for raid-structured storage systems.", "label": "label1:CS, label2:Structured Storage"}
